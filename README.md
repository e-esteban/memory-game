# Memory Game

This game is a test of memory. The challenge on this game is to match all the cards in as few moves at the least time possible.

# Game Overview

  - The game starts when a user clicks on a card to open. This also starts the game timer.
  - Only two cards are open at a time for comparison. Clicking a third card will not open it.
  - Each comparison of two cards will count as a game move.
  - Star Rating is based on the number of moves. The more moves a user makes, the less the stars.
  - The game ends when all the cards are matched.
