# Memory Game

This game is a test of memory. The challenge on this game is to match all the cards in as few moves at the least time possible.

# Game Overview

  - The game starts when a user clicks on a card to open. This also starts the game timer.
  - Only two cards are open at a time for comparison. Clicking a third card will not open it.
  - Each comparison of two cards will count as a game move.
  - Star Rating is based on the number of moves. The more moves a user makes, the less the stars.
  - The game ends when all the cards are matched.

Video tutorials from [Mike Wales](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rUH-sEs68Y) for development ideas and [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ophW7Ask_0) for creating the modal portion were a great help on this project. The shuffle function used in this project came from [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976). [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is a very good source of information for understanding about flexbox. [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_3dtransforms.asp) was a great reference for the animations of the card deck.
